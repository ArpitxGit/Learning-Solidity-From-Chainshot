# Enums make our code directed.

We provide after our code diffrent directions in different coditions to iterate differently.

So with the use of enums, we will declare some variables according to our need of directions/parameters...etc.

It makes our code structured, With the use of enums it is possible to reduce the number of bugs in your code.

enum values are stored as unsigned integers. If there are less than 256 values, it will be stored as a uint8. If you have more than 256 values it will use a uint16 and will grow from there as needed (although I'm not sure how many contracts will ever need more than 65536 values in their enum...). The way this data is stored will become more important when we look to parse our smart contracts from the outside world through the ABI.
