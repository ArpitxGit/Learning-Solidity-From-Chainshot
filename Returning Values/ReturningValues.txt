# Returning values in Soldiity is only useful for internal functions and blockchain queries.

Adding the *view* keyword to the function signature guarantees it will not modify state variables.

You can think of view functions as read-only; they can read the state of the contract but they cannot modify it.

The returns declaration not only helps the compiler check for compile-time errors in our code, it also is how it generates the ABI. 

This helps external programs communicate with our Solidity contract! 

We will learn more about returning values by implementing.
