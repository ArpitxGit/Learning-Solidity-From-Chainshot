#A signed integer can be declared with the keyword int.

Just like uint, the keyword int is short for a data type that will store 256 bits of memory, int256.

Since a integer is signed, the range covers both negative and positive numbers. 

##Let's compare the range of a uint8 to an int8:

uint8: Ranges from 0 to 255
int8: Ranges from -128 to 127

Notice that both ranges cover a total of 256 values, which is the total number of possible values that can be expressed with 8 bits.
