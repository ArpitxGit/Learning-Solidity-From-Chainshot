# We can create two types of byte arrays in Solidity: 

##fixed-size and dynamically-sized.

We can create byte sized arrays reserving anywhere from 1 to 32 bytes by adding the number as a suffix to *bytes*.

You can see that eacWhenever we go up 1 byte we can store two new hexadecimal characters. 

Each hexadecimal character can be represented in 4 bits.

## 4 bits together are called a nibble!
## That means each hexadecimal character can be represented by 1 nibble. 
## It also means two nibbles makes a byte!

### byte is an alias for bytes1
