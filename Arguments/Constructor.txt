# The constructor function is invoked only once during the contract's deployment and never again. 
## It is generally used for setting up initial contract values.

Solidity provides a constructor declaration inside the smart contract.

Is not a required function, defined with the constructor keyword.

This executes after contract creation, where it is possible to run contract initialization code.

This can be set to internal or public.

##The process that happens just before constructor runs:- 

State variable are set to their indiacated value when you perform initialization inline. If not, their values sets to zero.
			Once the constructor executes, the code moves to the blockchain.

A default constructor is created by the compiler if there is no explicitly defined constructor.

## We can pass an argument to our constructor!
